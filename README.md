# The Monetizr Campaigns SDK for Unity

Campaigns are the main ad units created by advertisers inside the Monetizr platform. Campaigns can include several branded missions, by accomplishing them players receive in-game rewards. 

Missions can be interconnected with game events. For example, mission can be locked until player reaches the specific game level or participates in a game quest. If a mission (game event) is completed, then players can be awarded with in-game or brand-sponsored rewards.
